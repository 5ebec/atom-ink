# Ink

This package provides a collection of IDE-related UI components for Atom â€“ for example,
inline results, loading indicators, an interactive console, etc. It's currently used
primarily in the [julia-client](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client) package to
provide IDE-like features for the Julia language. Documentation is currently a work in
progress, so check out that package and its code if you want to get a feel for how it looks
and works.
